    ICT4H was started as an internal group at ThoughtWorks, wanting to understand public health domain, and contribute
    towards building interoperable systems in eHealth. We are constantly learning about health services in public domain working closely with health service providers and technology providers in this space.  
    We keep dabbling with various relevant opensource softwares, understanding and working with their developer communities, bringing togther teams working on important open source projects, promoting interoperability and contributing with open source products, libraries & components, specifications/standards and if not anything with whatever brain & lung power we have!
